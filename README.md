# Going for an onsite and want to know how to answer HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT?  Have a verbal offer?  [Check out these templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16VeDlXdQBj7a7caMTgm7KMR_HeeGEjhj1SZZbkMnZDQ/edit?usp=sharing)

# Negotiation Emails

## After getting an offer

As soon as you get an offer:

1. Tell your career coach
2. Get as much as you can to make a decision.
3. Follow up with your other leads.
  * "I have an offer elsewhere"
  * "I really like what your company does"
  * "I'd love to go through your application process so that you I can include you in my final decision."

These are the companies you should contact:

* Companies you've interviewed with and are waiting to hear back from.
  * If you haven't written your standard thank-you-for-the-interview
  email, consolidate the two messages in the same email.
* Companies where you've scheduled a phone call or interview that falls
outside your deadline to make a decision on the existing offer.
* Companies that you haven't heard back from at all that seemed cool.

Here's a sample email for your inspiration.

> Hi {COMPANY CONTACT/COMPANY NAME},
>
> I applied to join your team last week. I wanted to let you know I've
> received another offer {from COMPANY NAME (if it's a good one)}. I
> have until {DATE} to get back to them. While it's an interesting offer,
> I admire what {COMPANY NAME} does and would love to see your application
> process through before making a final decision. I hope to hear back from
> your team soon.
>
> All the best,
>
> {YOUR NAME}

## If they are in a hurry

Many companies will want you to decide in less than a week. Resist this.
You're looking to make a long-term commitment and it's in no-one's
interest to rush your decision. If they insist, that's because they
want to lock you down before you get competing offers. This puts you in
a strong position to ask them for a higher offer. Here's a stock email
you take can inspiration from.

> My only concern is that I only started my job search a few weeks ago
> and am still in talks with several other companies. I have to consider
> the opportunity cost of taking myself off the job market before
> waiting to hear back from them. Could *company name* raise the base on
> the initial offer? Given a package with higher compensation, I would
> be in a better position to cut those conversations short and start on
> *the date* as you request. Let me know.

## If they give you a verbal offer 

 If a verbal offer is made, a response could be, “I’m very excited about the opportunity to work for you and this organization. Since this is such a significant decision for both of us, I’d be more comfortable if the offer was formalized in writing and I could look it over.”  or "This is an exciting opportunity and I will be looking forward to reviewing this information in an email."
 
 (If you already missed your chance to do this, you can consider writing a followup email where you reiterate the details of the verbal offer.  This isn't as good as an offer letter, but puts at least some details in writing in the meantime.)


## If the offer is low

Do not fret over asking for more. Companies do not have feelings. They
are however a lot more likely to invest in you and train you well if
they're paying a fair market rate.

These are real emails written by students. The outcome was successful in
both cases.

**Example 1**: with no competing offers.

> Thank you for extending me the offer of employment as a *job title* at
> *company name*. I really enjoyed getting to meet with *interviewer
> name*, *interviewer name*, and *interviewer name* on Monday and think
> the team is definitely the right cultural fit for me. Your company
> does some seriously interesting work and I think it's a great
> opportunity to learn skills that I won't find elsewhere.
>
> At this time, I do want to be transparent with you.  Based on my (previous experience, skills) and what I am seeing on Glassdoor and online, I was looking for a salary of $XXX,XXX.  Also, I am wondering if there might be an opportunity for a signing bonus.  If we could get the number to this range I would be able to make my decision quicker and also decline other upcoming interviews.  

> At the end of the day, for me it really is about the culture and fit and I am sure we will be able to find a solution that will be a win-win for everyone.

**Example 2**: no competing offers

> Thank you for sending that offer letter over! I really enjoyed getting to meet the whole *company* team and I think the 
> company is a great cultural fit for me. On top of that, I think *company* is creating a really awesome product and I 
> would have the opportunity to pick up skills that I won't find at other companies.
> 
> After reviewing the offer letter in more detail, I do have a few questions/concerns. First, I'm very excited about the 
> generous insurance that *company* offers to employees, and I was wondering whether or not that coverage also extends to 
> an employee's spouse. 
> 
> I am very eager to join the team at *company*, however I do have a small concern with the salary. Given that the average
> salary for a software engineer in *city* is 125k (link), and though I am just starting out, I see my market value
> as being 115k. I have always performed above average in the past, as indicated by my strong GPA at *university*. I am 
> confident that I will continue to maintain a high performance level at *company* and  contribute maximally to the
> company. If you were able to offer a salary of 115k, I would cancel all other interviews and sign immediately 
> (tonight), without waiting to hear back from other companies.
> 
> Again, I am really excited about the opportunity to work with *company*, and would love to start on *date*, as
> requested. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon!


**Example 3**: with competing offers.

> Thanks for sending this over! I think *company name* is a great
> company, and that I'd be a good fit. My one apprehension right now is
> the compensation. *Lowball figure* is on the low side of the offers I
> am considering, as well as what I am hearing from my peers. The average 
> is closer to *average in city*. This Indeed search
> shows a *number* average for a *job title* in *city* *links to
> Indeed search*. If you were able to raise the offer, I would feel much
> more comfortable accepting it.
>
> I know we discussed that one of my favorite things about *company
> name* was that *employee*, *employee*, and *employee* had all been
> there for over three years. That kind of longevity is amazing, and
> exactly what I'm looking for. This is my first big leap as a
> developer, so I'm looking for a longterm, 2+ year position where I can
> grow. I know *company name* provides that environment, and I know I
> would be a valuable asset to the *company* team. I look forward to
> hearing from you!

**Template**: a basic format for the emails is:
* Thanks so much for the offer
* I'm excited about your company for *specific reason*
* I have one minor concern about compensation
* My requested compensation (use a specific number that's higher than your goal so there's room to negotiate)
* Reason I feel I should be compensated
  * There are lots of reasons you might be a great fit for the company. Consider two things:   
    * Anything the company has mentioned that makes you a unique fit.  For example:
       * Culture is paramount to them and you fit in perfetly
       * They want someone with a finance background, which you have
       * Your take-home-project showed that you're a great UI designer and they need UI help
    * Anything that makes you a strong applicant or employee.  Some examples:
       * You attended a top school or had a high GPA
       * You were very successful in your previous jobs
       * You bring experience in management/tech/startups 
    * If you have other offers, then that's your strongest point
       * If your other offer is higher or is at a top company, say so
       * If not, say that you have another offer but would be certain about choosing their company if they increase the salary
* (If the offer is lower than average) Comparison to the a/A average or to developer salaries in *city*
* If these requests are met, I would be delighted to join

### Interviews in the pipeline with other companies - Letting them know

Hi Person,

I just want to take a moment to let you know that I just received an offer from one of the companies I have been interviewing with.  To be transparent, your company is my top choice.  Because of this, might there be an opportunity to expedite the process?  Since I am on a tight timeframe in my decision-making, I do look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.  I really do appreciate your time and consideration.


### Interviews in the pipeline (you just got an offer but you want to see other on site interviews through)

Thank you so much for your offer. I am very excited about the opportunity to work with such a great team!
Although (XXX Company) is my top choice, I wanted to be completely transparent and let you know that I have final round interviews this week with a couple of companies, and I’d like to see them through.I will ask them today to speed up the process if they do intend to make an offer, and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. 

Again, I am excited about the possibility of working with your team!
